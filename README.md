# Movies Dataset Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to transform a raw dataset of over 45,000 movies into a structured form and create a report that delivers insightful analyses. The dataset includes various attributes like genre, budget, popularity, ratings, and keywords. The objective is to tell a story with the data, focusing on meaningful analyses that can serve as a foundation for more complex studies.

## Objectives
- **Average Review Score Analysis**: Investigate the average review score for movies and its trend over time.
- **Genre Popularity**: Explore which genres are popular and how this has changed over time.
- **Budget and Popularity Relationship**: Examine if there's a correlation between production budget and movie popularity.
- **Production Houses Analysis**: Identify which production houses produce the best movies for each language.
- **Keyword Analysis**: Determine what keywords distinguish the most successful movies and explore common keywords in top-voted movies.
- **Genre-Specific Studies**: Compare the performance of specific genres, like ghost movies versus zombie movies.
- **Sequel Analysis**: Evaluate if movie sequels maintain or surpass the quality of the original, using the Toy Story series as a case study.
